    "The concepts of reciprocal space and the reciprocal lattice were first introduced by [Paul Peter Ewald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Peter_Ewald) (German crystallographer and physicist) in 1921 [[Annalen der Physik, 369, 3, 253 (1921)]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19213690304). The concept of reciprocal space is extremely helpful in understanding X-ray diffraction. It is therefore one of the core concepts in solid-state physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to construct the lattice of a given crystal structure in reciprocal space, it is first necessary to introduce a method of constructing the real space lattice. The Wigner–Seitz construction is one such method of constructing the real space primitive cell of a crystal. The counterpart (or \"dual\") of this Wigner-Seitz primitive cell in reciprocal space is called the 1st Brillouin zone."
